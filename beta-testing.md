# Beta Testing
## Beta Tester 1 (Judah) - Feedback
* When I press the slash key it disables controls until I click again
  * This is probably (definitely) a browser thing as normally on firefox it brings up a "quick find" searchbar
* Initially I didn't understand why the game went gray and stopped playing. Consider adding some text to say what has happened (win, lose, etc.) and differentiating the lose and win screens to make it more clear
* Very accurate to Tetris; can slide blocks on the ground and after rebinding the controls it feels pretty much the same, ghost piece is nice too
* I disagree with the default controls
* No major bugs, but potential UX problems with needing to modify json to remap controls and the previously mentioned unsurity around what it's trying to tell me

## Beta Tester 2 (My Mother) - Feedback
* I like the way the game looks
* The pacing (gravity) is good
