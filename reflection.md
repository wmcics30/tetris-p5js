### What advice would you give to yourself if you were to start a project like this again?
Look up what Premature Optimization is and avoid it like the plague.

### Did you complete everything in your "needs to have" list?
Almost. I put in a lot of time the night before I had to present trying to get everything done. As of writing this, the one thing I'm missing is a title screen.

### What was the hardest part of the project?
The GameDisplay class was pretty tricky to set up. Other than that, I had difficulty dealing with my past self's premature optimization. The insistence on doing things the hard way made the latter half of the project difficult, but learning how to scrap my old systems in exchange for easier ones was definitely useful.

### Were there any problems you could not solve?
None that I couldn't solve if given more time.

### What have you learned from this project that you can apply to future programming ventures?
Avoid premature optimization. Allow your program's code to be imperfect if it means you'll end up with a better user experience. Do things the easy way first, and then see about doing them the hard way.
